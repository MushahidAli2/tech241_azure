# Virtualization and Virtual Machines

## What is virtualization?

Virtualization is a technology that allows the creation and management of virtual resources, such as operating systems, storage, and networks, within a single physical hardware platform. It enables the efficient utilization of hardware resources by dividing them into multiple isolated environments, known as virtual machines (VMs), that can run different operating systems and applications simultaneously.

## What is a virtual machine?

A virtual machine (VM) is a software emulation of a physical computer system. It acts as an independent and isolated entity with its own virtualized hardware, including CPU, memory, storage, and network interfaces. Each VM runs its own operating system and applications, providing the illusion of a complete and dedicated computing environment.

## Where can virtual machines be run?

Virtual machines can be run on various platforms, including:

1. On-Premises Servers: Virtual machines can be deployed on dedicated servers within an organization's own data centers.
2. Public Cloud: Leading cloud service providers, such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud Platform (GCP), offer infrastructure for running virtual machines in their data centers.
3. Private Cloud: Organizations can create their private cloud environments, leveraging virtualization technologies like VMware vSphere or Microsoft Hyper-V, to run virtual machines.
4. Desktop Virtualization: Virtual machines can also be used on personal computers to create isolated environments for testing, development, or running multiple operating systems simultaneously.

## What determines how many virtual machines can run?

Several factors determine the number of virtual machines that can run on a given platform:

1. Hardware Resources: The physical hardware's capacity, such as CPU cores, memory, and storage, determines the number of virtual machines that can be effectively hosted.
2. Resource Allocation: The allocation of resources to each virtual machine, such as CPU cores, memory, and disk space, affects the total number of virtual machines that can run concurrently.
3. Workload Demand: The resource requirements of the applications and services running within the virtual machines influence the number of virtual machines that can be effectively supported.

## What does a virtual machine include?

A virtual machine typically includes the following components:

1. Virtual Hardware: Emulated hardware components, including CPU, memory, disk drives, network interfaces, and peripherals.
2. Operating System: Each virtual machine runs its own operating system, such as Windows, Linux, or macOS.
3. Applications: Virtual machines can host various applications and services, similar to a physical computer.
4. Storage: Virtual machines have access to virtualized storage, which can be in the form of virtual disks or network storage.
5. Network Interfaces: Virtual machines are equipped with virtual network interfaces to enable communication with other virtual machines and the external network.

## What software is required to orchestrate/run virtual machines?

To orchestrate and run virtual machines, the following software components are typically required:

1. Hypervisor: A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor (VMM), is responsible for creating and managing virtual machines on the physical hardware. Examples include VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, and KVM.
2. Virtualization Management Software: This software provides a management interface to control and monitor virtual machines, allocate resources, configure networking, and handle other administrative tasks. Examples include VMware vCenter, Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager, and Azure Virtual Machine Manager.

### What is the importance of an image when creating a VM?

An image is a template or snapshot of a virtual machine's configuration and state. It captures the operating system, applications, settings, and data required to create new instances of virtual machines. When creating a VM, an image serves as the foundation, allowing for quick and
